# JAY-BIT-BIZ
41-year young female. I currently am enrolled at Colorado Technical University have a little over a year to go before I have my BA in computer science and software engineering. I believe that tech has the opportunity to change the world in a more positive, educational  and simplify a number of possibilities.  Long as  humans run the control.
